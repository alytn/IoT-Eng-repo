Hello!
The Cocomelon Code folder and RaspberryPiFlask folder contain the code used for the final project.
This folder contains the code for the flask app created on the Raspberry Pi that listened for requests from the Linode server.
It is responsible for activating the LED light and servo motors on the gashapon machine in addition to alphabetizing usernames.

The youtube tutorials and other resources used for this code can be found in the references section in the README file in this repo.

Thank you!
